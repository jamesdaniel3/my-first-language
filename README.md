# my-first-language
Building a simple, interpreted language

Current Progress:
- Ints and Floats
- Variable Assignment 
- Display function:
  - takes in a variable or a valid input (currently float and int) and prints it to the console

Goals:
- Strings and Booleans 
- More built in functions
  - min, max
- if statements
- loops
- user definied functions
